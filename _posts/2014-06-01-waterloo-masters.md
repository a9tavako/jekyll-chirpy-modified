From 2012 to 2014 I was a master's student at [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/research-links/research-groups/infinite-dimensional-systems-research-group) working on Control Theory. My research was about finding the optimal place to place sensors. You can see my thesis [here](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/8551?show=full). 

At Waterloo, I did the well-known experiment in control theory about stabilizing a pendulum upright. Naturally, a pendulum wants to swing downwards, but if we move the base strategically, we can keep it upright. This is similar to balancing a pen upright on a your finger. 

You can see a video of it below.

The code was written in **Matlab**.
