From 2022 to 2023, I was a software engineer with [Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/) (S3) with [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/). My organization was S3 Index, which is the team responsible for management of S3 keys. 

My work was in disaster mitigation. To limit the blast radius of a catastrophic failure, we worked on separating the traffic into independent components so that if one component went down, only a smaller percentage of users would be affected. 

The tech stack I used were: [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [AWS Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) such as [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/), [SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/), [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/).
