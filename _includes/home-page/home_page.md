I am an applied mathematician and a software engineer. You can see my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/file/Arman_Tavakoli_CV.pdf) here. 

From 2022 to 2023, I was a backend engineer in [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) with [Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/) (S3). I worked on disaster mitigation, focusing on reducing the impact of catastrophic failures. I also worked on capacity forecasting for S3 Index fleets. This work used time series machine learning models to predict the future incoming customer traffic.  

I did my PhD at [Michigan State University](https://math.msu.edu/) from 2016 to 2021 in mathematics. My research was focused on dimension reduction of big data using probability and geometry. My advisors were [Mark Iwen](https://users.math.msu.edu/users/iwenmark/) and [Ben Schmidt](https://users.math.msu.edu/users/schmi444/).

I also worked on safety for airplane routes at [MDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDA_(company)) during 2014-2015. I worked on software that certified a given airplane route is safe to fly, and doesn't get too close to natural hazards such as mountains. 

In my undergraduate years, I interned at [IBM Toronto Software Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Toronto_Software_Lab) where I worked on the Java [Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/sdk-java-technology/8?topic=reference-jit-compiler). This work focused on performance optimization for Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
