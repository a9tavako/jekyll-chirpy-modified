I am an **applied mathematician** and a **software engineer**. You can see my [CV](/assets/files/Arman_Tavakoli_CV.pdf) here. 

From 2022 to 2023, I was a backend engineer in **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** with Simple Storage Service (S3). I worked on disaster mitigation, focusing on reducing the impact of catastrophic failures. I also worked on capacity forecasting for S3 Index fleets. This work used time series machine learning models to predict the future incoming customer traffic.  

I did my **PhD at Michigan State University** from 2016 to 2021 in mathematics. My research was focused on **dimension reduction of big data** using probability and geometry. My advisors were [Mark Iwen](https://users.math.msu.edu/users/iwenmark/) and [Ben Schmidt](https://users.math.msu.edu/users/schmi444/).

I also worked on **safety for airplane routes** at MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates **(MDA)** during 2014-2015. I worked on software that certified a given airplane route is safe to fly, and doesn't get too close to natural hazards such as mountains. 

In my undergraduate years, I interned at **IBM** where I worked on the Java Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler. This work focused on performance optimization for Java.
