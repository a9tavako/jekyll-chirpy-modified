- [On Fast Johnsonâ€“Lindenstrauss Embeddings of Compact Submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^N$ with Boundary](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-022-00420-w)
  - This paper gives guarantees for reducing the ambient dimension of a manifold object into a smaller dimension without distorting the shape more than some threshold. 


- [Lower bounds on the low-distortion embedding dimension of submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^N$](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1063520323000209)
  - This paper gives a lower bound for how much it is possible to reduce the ambient dimension of a manifold object without distorting it above a threshold. 


- [Wireless, passive strain sensor in a doughnut-shaped contact lens for continuous non-invasive self-monitoring of intraocular pressure](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/lc/c9lc00735k/unauth)
  - In collaboration with [MHM Kouhani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LecF418AAAAJ&hl=en) (a talented electrical engineer) and others, we investigated using a pressure sensor in a contact lense for measure the eye pressure. 

- [Characterizing unit spheres in Euclidean spaces via reach and volume](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.06161)
  - This paper shows that if a shape turns around and closes onto itself with a limit on curving and a limit on surface area, it must be a sphere. In higher dimensions a similar analog holds.
